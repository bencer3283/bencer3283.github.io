Our club had grown to be something like a photography agency. First, we undertake a lot of <strong>shooting commission</strong> from the school, graduation association, other performing art club, school alumni association... . Second, we set out to record the contemporary image of CK high as well as Taipei city. So we capture lots of <strong>news event</strong>, from sports contest of our school team to the national anniversary event around our school. Lastly, we made a lot of <strong>dive-in report</strong>, whether it's on the beloved restaurant near our school, on HBL basketball athletics, or on repectful teacher's departuring from CK high.</p>\n<p>My work as the president is highlighted by the coordination with our different partners within or out of the school. Most of them at the beginning thought we were just a high school club. A graet deal of <strong>communication skill</strong> along with our <strong>extensive photography-related works</strong> are the key for me to break their stereotype and convince them that we are actual professionals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2PzIOpx.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XC468FN.jpg\" alt=\"\">\nâ†‘ Me and my teamates at CKPC.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"President","subtitle":"CKSH Photography","meta_description":"43rd President of Chien Kuo Senior High Photography Club.
