The main benefit here is to allow users to choose ROI(region of interest) on the \"map\" captured by the OM with a vary big field of view, than automatically perform PMT scanning or other method by the LSCM on the ROI.</p>\n<p>My work involved mainly the adjustment, alignment and calibration of the two very precise optical system. Because we use a motorized stage to move the object between the two microscope, alignning and controling the motorized stage is also my work.</p>\n<p>The biggest challenge here is is the alignment of the three systems.
