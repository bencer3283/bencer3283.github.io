## Abstract

Since the outbreak of the pandemic, many industries have gone a very hard time. But some manages to stand out, one of the example is OTT platform. In this research, we found that active users and profit all gone up during 2020 from the financial report of some representative OTT platform. Well-established player in the market has experienced hike of profit, and newcomers also manages to hugely reduce its loss.

In order to understand the impact caused by the pandemic more comprehensively, we also conduct a survey to know if OTT platform does become more attractive to consumers.

In the results of our survey, we discover that the pattern and way of how people watch movie indeed changes. But most consumers didn't think the pandemic makes than more prone to subscription video services. By our statistic analysis, we found that only "family plan" can make consumers prefer subscription OTT platform.

**We think the most important proposal of this thesis** is the fact that the subscription sevice of OTT industry are not in such a good state as it seens like. We also exploer the difference of various consumers' preference on different subscription plan, hoping to figure out the possible future of the OTT industry.

新冠肺炎疫情爆發以來，許多產業受到前所未有的衝擊，但也有些產業異軍突起，OTT 影視串流平台即為其中之一。我們從代表性OTT 業者的財務資料中，發現在 2020 年間，OTT 業者的營收、訂閱人數都有顯著的成長。原有的 OTT 平台淨利節節攀升，草創期的 OTT 平台，也迅速減少營運初期的虧損，逐步邁向穩健的營運。

為了更全面地了解 OTT 產業受到疫情的影響，我們也透過問卷調查的方式，希望能更深入了解 OTT 平台的訂閱制方案是否因為疫情而更吸引消費者，以及其背後的影響因素。

在問卷調查的結果中，首先我們了解到消費者的觀影習慣有明顯的改變。但多數消費者並不認為疫情使其更傾向訂閱制。而我們夠過統計分析，也發現僅有「家庭方案」這個能夠降低價格的因素，能使訂閱制方案更有吸引力。

我們認為本研究最重要的意義在於，提出了 OTT 產業在看似強勁的成長背後，其訂閱制服務的吸引力可能不若表面上強勢。我們也在研究中探討不同族群的消費者是否會傾向不同的方案形式，希冀透夠過這些結果窺見 OTT產業未來的發展走向。
