`70th committe for school yearbook editing, CKSH, 2017-2018`

---

In the committe I worked as a team leader of around 100 members. Besides the actual editing itself, there is also a lot of coordinating, including work coopertion within the organization and working closely with our partner in the printing, fabric dying department while complying with the school's regulations.

We tried a lot of new things that is never done before. The most prominent one is the shell of the yearbook, which is made of hand-crafted plant-dyed fabric. The following video illustrate this alongside other breakthrough.
