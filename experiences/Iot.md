During the internship, I developed a internet of things network comprised of a self-designed intergrated device with temperature, humidity and illumination sensors as the node, and a Raspberry Pi based coordinator to upload informations to a SQL database.

The project involves mainly hardware design at a system level, and some fundamental software/firmware programming.

Check out the project on [Github](https://github.com/bencer3283/IoT-Lab).
