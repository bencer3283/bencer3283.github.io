`VIBES, 5th Art Exhibition of photography at CKSH, 2018`

---

As a curator, I have to lead a team of around 15 members. My work includes the selection of the collection, arranging different display category, and a lot of digital design. 

The exhibition display the photography work of CKPC in recent year. The highlight is the news photo works that depicted the incidents around CK high school as well as the taipei city.
