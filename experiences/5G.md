`categary of 5G innovative application, SEP 2020 - DEC 2020`

---

Our team consists of three members, my duty in the team are mainly designing the testing and demo environment of our product. My team ARGO has developed a AR platform that utilize advanced image-based spacial recognition algorithm to implement AR on personal mobile devices. Unlike most AR technology which needs beacons or light-labeling machine, our platform only needs the camera and image data to precisely define spacial characteristics and anchor AR odject with real-time interactive motion and live streaming.

The core know-how of ARGO is the spacial recognition algorithm to sense the position of the user and the AR environment around he or she. With the kindest help from our mentor Chang Tang Wen and my teammates, we win the championship and is awarded an prize equivqlent of *$10000 USD.*

I would like to give my deepest appreciation to my teammate **Wei Po Hen** and **Wei Yu Chan**.
