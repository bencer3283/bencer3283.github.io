`Logitech, FEB 2022 - JUN 2022`

As a intern in the mechanical engineering department, I improved my mechanical engineering skill and learned a lot about new product introduction. My main contribution is to incorporate some mechatronics integration skill like curcuit design, microcontroller programming to explore the possibility of a novel keyboard technology with electromagnet.

Another part of the intership is devoted to a UX research to find out the terget audience of this new keyboard technology.
