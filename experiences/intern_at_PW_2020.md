This projected, with development hosted by Lo Chao Yuan, was awarded the 2020 FutureTech Breakthrough Award by MOST of Taiwan. [(Towards Automatic Hyperspectral Imaging via the Combination of Sample Navigation Mapping and Laser Scanning Spectral Microscopy)](https://www.futuretech.org.tw/futuretech/index.php?action=winner_list_2020&utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Post&utm_campaign=Winner_list&web_lang=en-us)

Continuing [my project last year](/experiences/intern_at_PW_2019), this time my work is to combine the optical microscope and a in-house developed laser scanning confocal microscope to form a Micro-Mapping System. The main benefit here is to allow users to choose ROI(region of interest) on the "map" captured by the OM with a vary big field of view, than automatically perform PMT scanning or other method by the LSCM on the ROI.

My work involved mainly the adjustment, alignment and calibration of the two very precise optical system. Because we use a motorized stage to move the object between the two microscope, alignning and controling the motorized stage is also my work.

The biggest challenge here is is the alignment of the three systems. You can find more details in [this file](/docs/MMS-report.pdf).

Photonic Workshop and its labratorires are supervised and hosted by Doc. *Chang Yu Ming*.
