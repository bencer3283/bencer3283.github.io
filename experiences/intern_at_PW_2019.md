## Description:
Developing a confocal optics microscope that, for the first time at Photonic Workshop, utilizes 2 inches optics elements for the whole system and commercial full-frame camera to gain the largest field of view.

My work also includes working with Canon EDSDK and LabVIEW to create a accompanying software that can control the camera and take image.
