`43rd President of Chien Kuo Senior High Photography Club, 2016 - 2017`

---

During my time, CKPC is way beyond just a high school club. Our club had grown to be something like a photography agency. First, we undertake a lot of **shooting commission** from the school, graduation association, other performing art club, school alumni association... . Second, we set out to record the contemporary image of CK high as well as Taipei city. So we capture lots of **news event**, from sports contest of our school team to the national anniversary event around our school. Lastly, we made a lot of **dive-in report**, whether it's on the beloved restaurant near our school, on HBL basketball athletics, or on repectful teacher's departuring from CK high.

My work as the president is highlighted by the coordination with our different partners within or out of the school. Most of them at the beginning thought we were just a high school club. A graet deal of **communication skill** along with our **extensive photography-related works** are the key for me to break their stereotype and convince them that we are actual professionals.
