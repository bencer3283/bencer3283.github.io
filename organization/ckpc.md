`43rd President of Chien Kuo Senior High Photography Club, 2016 - 2017`

---

During my time, CKPC is way beyond just a high school club. Our club had grown to be something like a photography agency. First, we undertake a lot of **shooting commission** from the school, graduation association, other performing art club, school alumni association... . Second, we set out to record the contemporary image of CK high as well as Taipei city. So we capture lots of **news event**, from sports contest of our school team to the national anniversary event around our school. Lastly, we made a lot of **dive-in report**, whether it's on the beloved restaurant near our school, on HBL basketball athletics, or on repectful teacher's departuring from CK high.

My work as a president is highlighted by the coordination with our different partners within or out of the school. Most of them at the beginning thought we were just a high school club. A graet deal of **communication skill** along with our **extensive photography-related works** are the key for me to break their stereotype and convince them that we are actual professionals.
