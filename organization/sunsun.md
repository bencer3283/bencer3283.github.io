`8th NTU Sunshiner summer camp, APR. 2020 - AUG. 2020`

---

As the host of 2020 summer camp, I have to lead a core team of 6 member and coordinate with 31 volunteer teachers. Public relation with parents, schools and marketing are also my primary duties.

Ntu sunshiners is a student club that provides free english class for underprivileged children in Zhong-Li, taoyuan. Our class blends volcabulary, grammar and games together, and we think english learning resouces are the hardest to access for those families. Our work includes weekend class during school semesters and 3-5 days camp during summer/winter vacations.
